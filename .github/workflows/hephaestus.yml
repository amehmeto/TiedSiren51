# Hephaestus (Ἥφαιστος) - God of the forge in Greek mythology
# https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Hephaestus
#
# The divine blacksmith who crafts weapons and tools for the gods.
# He receives orders and transforms raw material into finished work.
#
# This workflow triggers when an issue is labeled 'ready'. It sets up
# the forge (worktree, branch, prompt) and puts Claude to work,
# hammering code until the PR is ready.
