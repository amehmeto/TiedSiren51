# Issue #213: Add confirmation modal before setting strict mode timer

## Summary
Add a confirmation modal when users enable strict mode for a block session timer.

## Motivation
Strict mode prevents users from exiting a block session early. A confirmation step ensures users understand they're committing to the full duration before starting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Show confirmation modal when strict mode is toggled on
- [ ] Modal explains that strict mode cannot be canceled
- [ ] User must confirm to proceed
