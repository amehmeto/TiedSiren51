# Expo SDK 55 Post-Upgrade Tech Debt

**Priority**: ⚠️ **MEDIUM**
**Created**: February 27, 2026
**Context**: Identified during SDK 51 → 55 upgrade (PR #405)

## Overview

The SDK 55 upgrade resolved the Prisma/New Architecture blocker by migrating to PowerSync. Several items were identified during the upgrade that don't block functionality but should be addressed.

## Items

### ~~1. `react-native-popup-menu` v0.16.1 — Unmaintained~~ ✅ RESOLVED

Replaced with custom `Modal` + `Pressable` popup in PR #405. `MenuProvider` removed from `AppWithInitialization.tsx`.

### ~~2. `react-native-elements` v3.4.3 — Unmaintained~~ ✅ RESOLVED

Replaced `CheckBox` with custom `CheckboxIndicator` component in PR #405. Dependency uninstalled.

### 3. `unstable_enablePackageExports = false` in Metro config

**Priority**: 📋 LOW
**Risk**: SDK 55 defaults this to `true`. Keeping it `false` may prevent some libraries from resolving correctly via `package.json` `exports` field.
**Impact**: Currently required for `firebase` + PowerSync compatibility

Location: `metro.config.cjs:7`

**Recommendation**: Re-evaluate periodically. When `firebase` and `@powersync/*` packages support Metro package exports, flip to `true` (or remove the line to use the default).

### 4. `TouchableHighlight` usage (2 files)

**Priority**: 📋 LOW
**Risk**: None — `TouchableHighlight` still works in RN 0.83
**Impact**: Inconsistent with rest of codebase which uses `Pressable`

Files:
- `ui/screens/Home/shared/IOSCancelButton.tsx`
- `ui/screens/Home/shared/IOSConfirmButton.tsx`

**Recommendation**: Replace with `Pressable` for consistency.

### 5. `@react-navigation/native` override in `package.json`

**Priority**: 📋 LOW
**Risk**: Override pins version to `7.1.28` to match expo-router's exact pin. If expo-router updates its pin, this override may cause version conflicts.
**Impact**: Required to prevent duplicate React context crash in BottomTabBar

Location: `package.json` `overrides` field

**Recommendation**: Remove the override after upgrading to a future expo-router version that resolves this deduplication natively.

### 6. Firebase Remote Config `indexedDB` guard in React Native

**Priority**: ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Risk**: Firebase web SDK's Remote Config requires `indexedDB` for caching, which is unavailable in React Native. Without the guard, `fetchAndActivate()` crashes at runtime.
**Impact**: Feature flags fall back to defaults in RN; remote config fetch is silently skipped.

Location: `infra/feature-flag-provider/firebase.feature-flag.provider.ts:24`

References:
- [firebase-js-sdk#2804](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/2804) — Firebase intentionally bubbles indexedDB errors (PR #2381)
- [firebase-js-sdk#3339](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/3339) — `firebase.remoteConfig` not available in Expo/RN

**Recommendation**: Migrate to `@react-native-firebase/remote-config` which uses native SDKs instead of the web SDK. This eliminates the `indexedDB` dependency entirely and enables proper caching on device.

### 7. Firebase Auth `getReactNativePersistence` missing TypeScript types

**Priority**: 📋 LOW
**Risk**: None at runtime. The function works correctly via Metro resolution. Only TypeScript types are affected.
**Impact**: Requires a module augmentation `.d.ts` file to satisfy the compiler.

Location: `infra/auth-gateway/firebase-auth-rn.d.ts`

References:
- [firebase-js-sdk#8332](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/8332) — TS types only cover browser targets
- [firebase-js-sdk#9316](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/9316) — Still unresolved as of Oct 2025

**Recommendation**: Remove `.d.ts` when Firebase ships proper RN type definitions. The official workaround (tsconfig paths to `index.rn.d.ts`) is fragile with nested `node_modules`.

## Resolved During Upgrade

- ✅ Prisma/New Architecture blocker — Replaced with PowerSync
- ✅ `Sentry.wrap()` conflict with expo-router v4 — Removed
- ✅ `@react-navigation/native` duplication (7.1.28 vs 7.1.30) — Fixed with npm overrides
- ✅ `strict-mode/index` tab naming for expo-router v4 — Verified correct
- ✅ `ViewStyle`/`TextStyle` mismatch in `TiedSTextLink.tsx` — Fixed
- ✅ `newArchEnabled` config — Not present (correct for SDK 55 where it's mandatory)
- ✅ `experiments.typedRoutes` — Still works in expo-router v4
- ✅ `react-native-popup-menu` — Replaced with custom `Modal` + `Pressable` popup (PR #405)
- ✅ `react-native-elements` — Replaced `CheckBox` with custom `CheckboxIndicator` (PR #405)
