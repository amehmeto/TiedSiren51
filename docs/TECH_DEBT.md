# Technical Debt & Future Improvements

> Created: January 28, 2025  
> Status: Living document  
> Purpose: Track planned improvements for the Prisma local-first implementation

## Current State
The initial Prisma implementation provides basic local-first database functionality with SQLite. While functional, several areas have been identified for future improvement when the app scales.

## Planned Improvements

### 1. Prisma Client Generation 🔄
**Priority: Medium** | **Effort: Low**
- Add `generate-client` and `postinstall` scripts
- Move from direct npx calls to package.json scripts
- Improves CI/CD and developer experience

### 2. Error Handling Enhancement 🐛
**Priority: High** | **Effort: Medium**
- Create custom error types
- Improve error messages and tracing
- Add proper error handling patterns
- Current generic errors might hide important details

### 3. Database Configuration ⚙️
**Priority: Low** | **Effort: Medium**
- Make database path configurable
- Add environment-specific configurations
- Document database file locations
- Current hardcoded path might cause issues in different environments

### 4. Migration Strategy 📦
**Priority: Medium** | **Effort: High**
- Document migration strategy for local-first architecture
- Add migration scripts
- Plan for handling schema changes across app updates
- Critical for app updates without data loss

### 5. Testing Coverage 🧪
**Priority: Medium** | **Effort: High**
- Add integration tests
- Test edge cases for JSON fields
- Test concurrent operations
- Current unit tests might miss real-world scenarios

### 6. Performance Optimization 🚀
**Priority: Low** | **Effort: High**
- Add strategic indexes
- Monitor JSON field sizes
- Implement connection pooling if needed
- Only needed when we have performance data from real usage

## Trigger Points
When to revisit these improvements:
- Error Handling: When seeing first error reports from users
- Migration Strategy: Before first app update with schema changes
- Testing: When reaching 1000 active users
- Performance: When operations take >100ms or DB size >10MB

## Notes
- This is not an exhaustive list
- Priorities may change based on user feedback and app metrics
- Should be reviewed quarterly
